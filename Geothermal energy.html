    <h4>Geothermal energy</h4>


    <body class="background6">
        <p2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just under the earth's crust are massive amounts of thermal energy, which originates from both the original formation of the planet and the radioactive decay of minerals. Geothermal energy in the form of hot springs has
            been used by humans for millennia for bathing, and now it's being used to generate electricity. In North America alone, there's enough energy stored underground to produce 10 times as much electricity as coal currentry does.</p2>
