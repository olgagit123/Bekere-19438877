    <h4>Wind power</h4>


    <body class="background4">
        <p2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Air flow on the earth's surfas can be used to push turbines, with stronger winds producing more energy. High-altitude sites and areas just offshore tend to provide the best conditions for capturing the strongest winds.
            According to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a network of land-based, 2.5-megawatt wind turbines in rural areas operating at just 20% of their rated capacity could supply 40 times the current worldwide
            consumption of energy. </p2>
