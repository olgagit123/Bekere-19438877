    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Green energy comes from natural sourses such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, plants, algae and geothermal heat. These energy resources are renewable, meaning they're naturally replenished. In contrast, fossil fuels are a finite
        resource that take millions of years to develop and will continue to diminish with use.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renewable energy sources also have a much smaller impact on the environment than fossil fuel, wich produce pollutants such as greenhouse
        gases as by-product, contributing to climate change. Gaining access to fossil fuels typically requires either mining or drilling deep into the earth, often in ecologically sensitive locations.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green energy, however,
        utilizes energy sources that are readily available all over the world, including in rural and remote areas that don't otherwise have access to electricity. Advances in renewable energy technologies have lowered the cost of solar panels, wind turbines
        and other sources of green energy, placing the ability to produce electricity in the hands of the people rather than those of oil, gas, coal and utility companies.</p>

    <h2> Types of green energy</h2>

    <p> Research into renewable, non-polluting energy sources is advancing at such a fast pace, it's hard to keep track of the many types of green energy that are now in development. Here are 6 of the most common types of green energy:</p>
